# The READit project

READit is a research project aimed at understanding how shared book reading interventions can be made effective at large scale. The project involves potentiallly 500 schools and 40,000 families in Denmark.

READit builds on the READ project (Research on Educational Achievement and Development) (see [publication](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1607946113)). READit has added an IT platorm to READ. On the platform participating parents and children may find additional e-books and advise on how to do shared book reading with their primary school children.

To adhere to the norms of open science, this project website makes publicly available information about the project. At the [github repository](https://github.com/simon-calmar-andersen/READit) all amendments to the project website can be tracked.

At the [project page](https:simon-calmar-andersen.github.io/READit/project) general information about the project may be found including a summary of the application. Information about the four workpackages are found on the subsites:



The project is funded by DKK 20 million from The Novo Nordic Foundation.
